<p>
I attended and pitched one of my ideas at <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/indonesia/bali/startup-weekend/6461" target="_blank">Startup Weekend Bali 2015</a> in Ubud, Bali, held at the coworking space there <a href="http://www.hubud.org" target="_blank">hubud</a>. My idea, <a href="http://www.designmyday.co/" target="_blank">Design My Day</a>, and pitch were well-received and I was able to gather an extraordinary team. We worked very well together for the weekend and came up with a powerful pitch that ended up being awarded the winning startup for the weekend. Now it is time to build out our concept and see if the world embraces it as something helpful.
