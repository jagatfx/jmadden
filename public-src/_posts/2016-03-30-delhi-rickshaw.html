I recently joined the <a href="http://www.techvalleygamespace.com" target="_blank">Tech Valley Game Space (TVGS)</a> and participated in their first "Shark Tank" event where people present game ideas and the winning pitch gets access to volunteers to create a game over the following month. My pitch of a game idea called <a href="http://www.techvalleygamespace.com/project-night-delhi-rickshaw-shark-tank-2-march-30-2016" target="_blank">"Delhi Rickshaw"</a> was the winning pitch and we spent the last month developing the idea in Unity. It was a lot of fun to have a push towards finally sitting down to learn the essentials of Unity. I was impressed by how easy the engine is to work with and enjoyed coding in C#. The tutorials from Unity like the Tank Tutorial were also very helpful to get up and running and the key aspects of a game.

The Delhi Rickshaw game idea came from my time abroad in Southeast Asia. I was fascinated by the different styles of rickshaw in the various cities and wanted to make a game that merged the perspective of the original Grand Theft Auto, the business idea of Lemonade stand and future clones, and the competition and gamification of R.C. Pro-Am.
